       "A small manufacturer must choose between two suppliers for a critical component needed within 7 days. Each supplier has a per-unit price and a probabilistic delivery time (lead time). You know only the following partial information:\n",
       "- Supplier A: price = $100; lead time L_A is approximately Normal with mean μ_A = 5 days and standard deviation σ_A = 1 day (lead times are nonnegative in reality; the normal distribution is a rough approximation). If the part arrives after day 7, a lateness penalty of $60 per day is charged.\n",
       "- Supplier B: price = $90; lead time L_B is approximately Normal with mean μ_B = 8 days and standard deviation σ_B = 2 days (also approximated as nonnegative). The same lateness penalty applies.\n",
       "Assume the lateness penalty is the only penalty cost beyond the upfront price, and that there are no other holding or urgent-supply costs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Question: Which supplier minimizes the expected total cost under this model? Provide the final answer and accompany it with the requested analyses below.\n",
       "\n",
       "(1) Final answer\n",
       "Choose Supplier A. Under the Normal-approximation lead-time model (with L_A ~ N(5,1^2) and L_B ~ N(8,2^2), truncated to be nonnegative for realism), the expected total costs are:\n",
       "- Supplier A: upfront $100 plus expected lateness cost ≈ $0.50, for a total ≈ $100.50.\n",
       "- Supplier B: upfront $90 plus expected lateness cost ≈ $83.74, for a total ≈ $173.74.\n",
       "Thus Supplier A has the lower expected total cost by a wide margin.\n",
       "\n",
       "(2) Concise justification (3–5 sentences)\n",
       "Using the given means and sds, compute the expected lateness beyond day 7 as E[(L − 7)+] for each supplier under the normal model: for A (μ=5, σ=1) this is about 0.0084 days, giving an expected lateness penalty ≈ $0.50; for B (μ=8, σ=2) this is about 1.396 days, giving a penalty ≈ $83.74. Adding the upfront prices yields total expected costs of about $100.50 for A and $173.74 for B. The sizable difference in expected lateness penalties dominates the $10 upfront price difference, making A the better choice under this model.\n",
       "\n",
       "(3) Critical appraisal of key assumptions and data limitations\n",
       "- The core calculation relies on treating lead times as Normal distributions with the given means and std devs, which is a rough approximation because real-world lead times are nonnegative and can be skewed.\n",
       "- We implicitly ignore any potential correlation between lead time and other costs, and we assume the lateness penalty is linear in days late with a fixed rate.\n",
       "- We assume no inventory, safety stock, or expedite options; in practice, suppliers may offer rush options or batching effects.\n",
       "- The model uses a single fixed deadline (7 days) and does not account for variability in demand or production schedules downstream.\n",
       "- Truncation to nonnegative lead times is small here but should be acknowledged; a more realistic model might use a nonnegative distribution (e.g., lognormal) which could slightly alter the numbers.\n",
       "\n",
       "(4) Comparison of at least two alternative solution approaches with their trade-offs\n",
       "- Approach 1: Parametric normal lead-time model (the approach used above)\n",
       "  - Pros: Simple to compute; yields closed-form expressions for E[(L−7)+] with standard normal functions; transparent assumptions.\n",
       "  - Cons: Relies on the (potentially imperfect) Normal assumption and may misestimate tails, especially for longer delays; ignores nonnegativity explicitly (though truncation makes this minor here).\n",
       "- Approach 2: Scenario-based Monte Carlo simulation (nonparametric or mixed distributions)\n",
       "  - Pros: Flexible; can incorporate skew, truncation, and alternative distributions (e.g., lognormal, empirical data); allows computing a distribution of total costs and confidence intervals.\n",
       "  - Cons: Requires choosing and calibrating multiple plausible distributions; more computational effort; results depend on the chosen scenarios and their weights.\n",
       "- Approach 3 (optional): Distribution-free bounds using only mean and variance (robust bound)\n",
       "  - Pros: Does not rely on distributional shape; provides worst-case guarantees given μ and σ.\n",
       "  - Cons: Typically yields very loose bounds for E[(L−7)+], may be too pessimistic to be actionable; not as informative for decision between two suppliers.\n",
       "\n",
       "(5) Self-rated confidence score and rationale\n",
       "Confidence: 0.65\n",
       "Rationale: The conclusion follows from a transparent calculation under a plausible parametric model, but the choice of Normal lead-time distributions is a simplification. Real-world lead times can be skewed and nonnegative, and penalties or delivery options in practice may deviate from the assumed linear, daily lateness cost. The result is informative and reasonable under the stated model, but it should be revisited if more detailed lead-time data or alternative cost structures become available."

If the part arrives after day 7, a lateness penalty of $60 per day is charged.\\n- Supplier B: price = $90; lead time L_B is approximately Normal with mean μ_B = 8 days and standard deviation σ_B = 2 days (also approximated as nonnegative). The same lateness penalty applies.\\nAssume the lateness penalty is the only penalty cost beyond the upfront price, and that there are no other holding or urgent-supply costs.\\n\\nQuestion: Which supplier minimizes the expected total cost under this model? Provide the final answer and accompany it with the requested analyses below.\\n\\n(1) Final answer\\nChoose Supplier A. Under the Normal-approximation lead-time model (with L_A ~ N(5,1^2) and L_B ~ N(8,2^2), truncated to be nonnegative for realism), the expected total costs are:\\n- Supplier A: upfront $100 plus expected lateness cost ≈ $0.50, for a total ≈ $100.50.\\n- Supplier B: upfront $90 plus expected lateness cost ≈ $83.74, for a total ≈ $173.74.\\nThus Supplier A has the lower expected total cost by a wide margin.\\n\\n(2) Concise justification (3–5 sentences)\\nUsing the given means and sds, compute the expected lateness beyond day 7 as E[(L − 7)+] for each supplier under the normal model: for A (μ=5, σ=1) this is about 0.0084 days, giving an expected lateness penalty ≈ $0.50; for B (μ=8, σ=2) this is about 1.396 days, giving a penalty ≈ $83.74. Adding the upfront prices yields total expected costs of about $100.50 for A and $173.74 for B. The sizable difference in expected lateness penalties dominates the $10 upfront price difference, making A the better choice under this model.\\n\\n(3) Critical appraisal of key assumptions and data limitations\\n- The core calculation relies on treating lead times as Normal distributions with the given means and std devs, which is a rough approximation because real-world lead times are nonnegative and can be skewed.\\n- We implicitly ignore any potential correlation between lead time and other costs, and we assume the lateness penalty is linear in days late with a fixed rate.\\n- We assume no inventory, safety stock, or expedite options; in practice, suppliers may offer rush options or batching effects.\\n- The model uses a single fixed deadline (7 days) and does not account for variability in demand or production schedules downstream.\\n- Truncation to nonnegative lead times is small here but should be acknowledged; a more realistic model might use a nonnegative distribution (e.g., lognormal) which could slightly alter the numbers.\\n\\n(4) Comparison of at least two alternative solution approaches with their trade-offs\\n- Approach 1: Parametric normal lead-time model (the approach used above)\\n  - Pros: Simple to compute; yields closed-form expressions for E[(L−7)+] with standard normal functions; transparent assumptions.\\n  - Cons: Relies on the (potentially imperfect) Normal assumption and may misestimate tails, especially for longer delays; ignores nonnegativity explicitly (though truncation makes this minor here).\\n- Approach 2: Scenario-based Monte Carlo simulation (nonparametric or mixed distributions)\\n  - Pros: Flexible; can incorporate skew, truncation, and alternative distributions (e.g., lognormal, empirical data); allows computing a distribution of total costs and confidence intervals.\\n  - Cons: Requires choosing and calibrating multiple plausible distributions; more computational effort; results depend on the chosen scenarios and their weights.\\n- Approach 3 (optional): Distribution-free bounds using only mean and variance (robust bound)\\n  - Pros: Does not rely on distributional shape; provides worst-case guarantees given μ and σ.\\n  - Cons: Typically yields very loose bounds for E[(L−7)+], may be too pessimistic to be actionable; not as informative for decision between two suppliers.\\n\\n(5) Self-rated confidence score and rationale\\nConfidence: 0.65\\nRationale: The conclusion follows from a transparent calculation under a plausible parametric model, but the choice of Normal lead-time distributions is a simplification. Real-world lead times can be skewed and nonnegative, and penalties or delivery options in practice may deviate from the assumed linear, daily lateness cost. The result is informative and reasonable under the stated model, but it should be revisited if more detailed lead-time data or alternative cost structures become available.', '**Problem (self‑contained)**  \\nA delivery van is scheduled to travel from City\\u202fX to City\\u202fZ, passing through City\\u202fY.  \\n* The van’s fuel tank can hold 200\\u202fL of diesel.  \\n* While the vehicle is fully loaded (first 200\\u202fkm of the trip) it consumes diesel at a rate of 0.10\\u202fL\\u202fkm⁻¹.  \\n* After the first 200\\u202fkm the load is halved (fuel consumption drops to 0.08\\u202fL\\u202fkm⁻¹ for the remainder of the journey).  \\n* The distance from X to Y is exactly 500\\u202fkm.  \\n* The distance from Y to Z is unknown but is estimated to lie between 700\\u202fkm and 900\\u202fkm.  \\n* The driver wants to arrive at City\\u202fZ without refueling.  \\n\\n**Question**  \\nWhat is the *maximum* possible distance from City\\u202fY to City\\u202fZ that allows the van to reach Z without refueling, given the above partial information and assumptions?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1.

      "A small manufacturer must choose between two suppliers for a critical component needed within 7 days. Each supplier has a per-unit price and a probabilistic delivery time (lead time). You know only the following partial information:\n",
      "- Supplier A: price = $100; lead time L_A is approximately Normal with mean μ_A = 5 days and standard deviation σ_A = 1 day (lead times are nonnegative in reality; the normal distribution is a rough approximation). If the part arrives after day 7, a lateness penalty of $60 per day is charged.\n",
      "- Supplier B: price = $90; lead time L_B is approximately Normal with mean μ_B = 8 days and standard deviation σ_B = 2 days (also approximated as nonnegative). The same lateness penalty applies.\n",
      "Assume the lateness penalty is the only penalty cost beyond the upfront price, and that there are no other holding or urgent-supply costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Which supplier minimizes the expected total cost under this model? Provide the final answer and accompany it with the requested analyses below.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Final answer\n",
      "Choose Supplier A. Under the Normal-approximation lead-time model (with L_A ~ N(5,1^2) and L_B ~ N(8,2^2), truncated to be nonnegative for realism), the expected total costs are:\n",
      "- Supplier A: upfront $100 plus expected lateness cost ≈ $0.50, for a total ≈ $100.50.\n",
      "- Supplier B: upfront $90 plus expected lateness cost ≈ $83.74, for a total ≈ $173.74.\n",
      "Thus Supplier A has the lower expected total cost by a wide margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Concise justification (3–5 sentences)\n",
      "Using the given means and sds, compute the expected lateness beyond day 7 as E[(L − 7)+] for each supplier under the normal model: for A (μ=5, σ=1) this is about 0.0084 days, giving an expected lateness penalty ≈ $0.50; for B (μ=8, σ=2) this is about 1.396 days, giving a penalty ≈ $83.74. Adding the upfront prices yields total expected costs of about $100.50 for A and $173.74 for B. The sizable difference in expected lateness penalties dominates the $10 upfront price difference, making A the better choice under this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Critical appraisal of key assumptions and data limitations\n",
      "- The core calculation relies on treating lead times as Normal distributions with the given means and std devs, which is a rough approximation because real-world lead times are nonnegative and can be skewed.\n",
      "- We implicitly ignore any potential correlation between lead time and other costs, and we assume the lateness penalty is linear in days late with a fixed rate.\n",
      "- We assume no inventory, safety stock, or expedite options; in practice, suppliers may offer rush options or batching effects.\n",
      "- The model uses a single fixed deadline (7 days) and does not account for variability in demand or production schedules downstream.\n",
      "- Truncation to nonnegative lead times is small here but should be acknowledged; a more realistic model might use a nonnegative distribution (e.g., lognormal) which could slightly alter the numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Comparison of at least two alternative solution approaches with their trade-offs\n",
      "- Approach 1: Parametric normal lead-time model (the approach used above)\n",
      "  - Pros: Simple to compute; yields closed-form expressions for E[(L−7)+] with standard normal functions; transparent assumptions.\n",
      "  - Cons: Relies on the (potentially imperfect) Normal assumption and may misestimate tails, especially for longer delays; ignores nonnegativity explicitly (though truncation makes this minor here).\n",
      "- Approach 2: Scenario-based Monte Carlo simulation (nonparametric or mixed distributions)\n",
      "  - Pros: Flexible; can incorporate skew, truncation, and alternative distributions (e.g., lognormal, empirical data); allows computing a distribution of total costs and confidence intervals.\n",
      "  - Cons: Requires choosing and calibrating multiple plausible distributions; more computational effort; results depend on the chosen scenarios and their weights.\n",
      "- Approach 3 (optional): Distribution-free bounds using only mean and variance (robust bound)\n",
      "  - Pros: Does not rely on distributional shape; provides worst-case guarantees given μ and σ.\n",
      "  - Cons: Typically yields very loose bounds for E[(L−7)+], may be too pessimistic to be actionable; not as informative for decision between two suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5) Self-rated confidence score and rationale\n",
      "Confidence: 0.65\n",
      "Rationale: The conclusion follows from a transparent calculation under a plausible parametric model, but the choice of Normal lead-time distributions is a simplification. Real-world lead times can be skewed and nonnegative, and penalties or delivery options in practice may deviate from the assumed linear, daily lateness cost. The result is informative and reasonable under the stated model, but it should be revisited if more detailed lead-time data or alternative cost structures become available.\n",
